# This workflow file was intentionally left as a marker to preserve history.
# The actual Trivy job was moved into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (job `trivy-scan`).
# This file is configured for manual dispatch only and contains a no-op job so the
# workflow remains valid to GitHub Actions while avoiding automated runs.
